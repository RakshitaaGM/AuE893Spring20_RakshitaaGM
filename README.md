Hello,

I am Rakshitaa Geetha Mohan from India. I am pursuing Graduate studies at Clemson University International Center of Automotive Research. I did my Undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering at National Institute of Technology-Tiruchirappalli, India.

My field of interest is Autonomous vehicles. I am interested in controls and coding.I have experience in coding in C, C++, MATLAB. 

As Autonomy is my field, I also have to learn coding in Python and ROS. 
To facilitate that, I have taken a course called, Autonomy Science and Systems. 
I have created this Repository to store my Assignment files and other files related to that.
